If you're going to work with big data, you'll probably be using R or Python. And if you're using Python, you'll be definitely using Pandas and NumPy, the third-party packages designed specifically for data analysis. This course provides an opportunity to learn about them. Michele Vallisneri shows how to set up your analysis environment and provides a refresher on the basics of working with data containers in Python. Then he jumps into the big stuff: the power of arrays, indexing, and DataFrames in NumPy and Pandas. He also walks through two sample big-data projects: one using NumPy to analyze weather patterns and the other using Pandas to analyze the popularity of baby names over the last century. Challenges issued along the way help you practice what you've learned.
